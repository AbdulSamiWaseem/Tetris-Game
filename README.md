This tetris assembly game in the DOS environment. It involves multiple sections for handling delays, printing to the screen, clearing the screen, and managing scores and other game elements. The code heavily uses BIOS video memory (0xB800) for displaying content and interacts with the keyboard using in al, 0x60 for inputs.

Key Sections:
Clock Management:

The clock procedure manages countdown logic with minutes and seconds.
It decrements the seconds and minutes and displays the updated time.
Printing Functions:

printClockSTR, printNum, and print are utilities for printing strings and numbers to the screen at specified positions using the video memory.
Game Logic (s1, s2, s3, s4):

These sections seem to represent different stages or levels of the game.
The logic handles movements, obstacle management, and interactions based on keyboard input (left, right).
They also include collision detection using comparisons against pre-defined obstacle data.
Screen Clearing:

clrscr and clrscr2 reset the screen by overwriting all video memory with blank spaces or custom layouts.
End Game Logic:

When certain conditions are met (like a collision or a timer running out), the game calls the end sequence (end*) and displays a message.
Delays and Timings:

The Delay function is a simple loop-based delay to control the game's speed.
Improvements and Comments:
Optimization:

Reuse code by combining repetitive sequences (like s1, s2, s3, s4) into a parameterized function.
Readability:

Add comments explaining the purpose of each section and its variables for better understanding.
Input Handling:

Expand input checks to ensure compatibility with more keys or to improve responsiveness.
Structure:

The game could benefit from modular design, grouping related functionalities into reusable and parameterized functions.
Debugging:

Integrate a debug mode to display additional information like memory addresses or intermediate states.
Error Handling:

Add safeguards for invalid memory access or unexpected inputs.
